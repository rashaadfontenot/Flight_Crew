I've heard about these scams but never tried to understand how they work...until now. 
My new found love of Python and a very ambitous mind gives me enough reason to try to replicate this scam. 
The first thing I had to do was find out the math behind it. A term called Geometric Sequences!

Once I kind of wrapped my head around that, I then had to figure out recursion works in python.
